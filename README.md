Who needs another blogging platform?

Right, so I am not suggesting anyone to use it, it's rather me reflecting on the code.

The idea is to carry on building on top of Laravel, and not using extensions as much as possible.

Extensions are wonderful, but it's under other person's control. And when that other person decides to cease developing, you are on your own to study it all from scratch, figure out and fix bugs, etc.

For more complex extensions you find yourself programming not in Laravel anymore, but following some wierd logic of an unknown hero developer.

Well, this repo is going to be result of some ongoing code studies.

I will have a working blogging platform eventually, but that is optional. Real goal is to fix my thoughts during the development process and some code to use in other projects.

I am going to start with the current version of Laravel and update it whenever new ones become available.

Other than that, Alpine will probably be used whenever interactivity is needed.

The little additional technologies used the better.

So, this is the concept, feel free to look around, and comment if you wish.

Best,
Andrew
